 ShoeFit – Find Your Perfect Shoe Size

What Shoefit Does
Shoefit is an app that helps you find your accurate shoe size using just your smartphone camera.
You take a quick photo of your feet, and Shoefit automatically calculates your exact measurements, length and width. No measuring tape. No size charts. No guessing.
Shoefit then recommends the correct shoe size for you, even across different brands (because a size 40 in one brand can be a 41 in another). 

Why It Matters
- Buying shoes should be fun, not stressful.Most people guess their size, you are not sure whether to buy size 40 or 41 and that often leads to:
- Shoes that are too tight or too loose
- Wasted money on returns or exchanges
- Frustration and disappointment
Shoefit removes the guesswork. By knowing your correct size before you buy, you:
- Get shoes that fit perfectly
- Save time and avoid returns
- Feel confident when shopping in-store or online
- Shoefit helps you shop smarter and step comfortably.

Who Shoefit is for
- Everyday shoe shoppers who buy shoes online and want the correct size without guessing.
- Parents buying shoes for kids.
- Shoe vendors and e-commerce stores who want to reduce returns and improve customer satisfaction.
- Anyone who wants shoes that *actually fit*
